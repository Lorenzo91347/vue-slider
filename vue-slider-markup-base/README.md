# Carousel Vue Js

In this exercise a carousel is created utilizing a Function
in Vue Js,calling to an object array in the function itself to populate the Dom with content,and create a carousel of images with titles and text.
the Html,Css and Vanilla Js markups were provided at the start,but modified to some extent in the first two's case.

1. Connect the Js file to the Vue precompiled online file.
2. Create the app function.
3. In the Data section move the object array in a way that facilitates the call from the DOM.
4. link the Css class for the main image to the function,and then to the Dom.
5. Create the methods for the previous and next buttons,in this case an Index incrementation/decrementation through a @click
event listener(Vue style).
